# Surface-Crack-Detection
Concrete surface crack detection using deep learning , done using python

The model is trained with different architectures



The final prediction is done using CNN




Should run the CNN_final.ipynb file and save the model as ".h5" file , then load it in to "Front_End" code 




Front End is done using Streamlit
